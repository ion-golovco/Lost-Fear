---last chapter---
"maybe well see someday the stars in the rain
we had a dream were we were close to cry
in the rain that was about to freeze
so that we woldnt lose anything else
we simply drew close to one another
maybe well see someday the stars in the rain
I found a reason to breathe
Beyond the bright lights
It shows
When it's all over I see
I just want to hold onto this dream
We're going in circles again
I wouldn't trade it for anything
maybe well see someday the stars in the rain

Blue flowers bloomed
on the night of summer
even had forgotten the seasons

Glow of distant town,
and the treasure map
grew hazy as if illusions

I couldn’t 
trust anything
I could Only keep walking
and searching for a ray of hope
That's all I could do

Under this crying sky,
My shoulder’s trembling
It’s drowning 
our only magic
How sad, we couldn’t even follow our path anymore
Let's sleep,
as for morning will come
Good Night...

Before I know it,
When I opened my eyes,
Summer rain had stopped

Stop the time
that slowly flows,
I prayed at the god of this world

“I want to know more,
every single thing about you.”
I want this spinning love to reach you
That's all i wish

Those melted colors have become one
and start to paint 
a path to cross the night
Good Night...

I want to unite our future
on that night rainbow
that blooms within this summer sky
That’s all my wish

I believe,  we can reach
the next path towards that sky
Until we can recall Our forgotten dreams
and that gentle melody
Let's sleep, 
till morning comes

Good Night...
maybe well see someday the stars in the rain
till morning comes
Good Night...
...

---misc---

What do you desire
the clear sky ...

why do you fight knowing that it is a life that will end at some point
knowing that the life has been already spent  
why do you cling on,trying to continue living
even though you realize that in your future
there is no salvation

you'll find out why you hold your shield up to protect others

warriors can win without blades and war

Humans can't live without a wish, a desire
